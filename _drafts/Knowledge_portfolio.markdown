# Knowledge portfolio
In the fantastic [The Pragmatic Programmer][pragmatic] there's a section fully dedicated to your *knowledge portfolio* and how you should keep it updated.

## What is a knowledge portfolio?

## How can I keep track of my knowledge portfolio?
Right now I'm in love with [vimwiki][vim], and the general recommendation are plain-text notes.

This means, from [Evernote][ever] to using a git server -like [github][github] or [bitbucket][bit]- with notes in text files.

Of course you could keep track with some Word document and Dropbox, for instance, but you would be depending on external -paid- tools too much.
## General recommendations
Read one book per quarter. If you can, after this, evolve to one monthly.

The first option might not look like much, but compared to most of your peers --or yourself, otherwise-- it will make a difference.

Opinions and thoughts are welcomed!

title: "Generate Release Notes for Github"
---

[Github][gh] allows to add [releases][release]. This is convenient, but tedious. Below is a way to automate it.

You may add this aliases to your git configuration. [Jes√∫s Canales][jesus] handcrafted them, and handed them to me, as I saw they - [backend people][engineering]- were using something for automatically getting the commits that belonged to a [release][git-flow].

{% highlight bash %}
ri = !f() { git loc `git lt`..develop --no-merges; }; f
loc = log --pretty=format:-(%h)%s
lt = describe --tags --abbrev=0
{% endhighlight %}

Now:

* With `git lt` you'll get the latest tag created
* `git loc` tells you the differences between two pointers
* Finally `git ri` shows the differences between the last created tag, and develop.

Actually, `git ri` **crashes** for me, but I can execute:

{% highlight bash %}
git loc `git lt`..develop --no-merges
{% endhighlight %} sepparatedly

The `--no-merges` flag helps to remove useless commits that only indicate that content was merged.

Now you only need to visit a previous published [--tag][tag] and click on the _Release Notes_ link on the right

All this can be used to generate a script using [Github's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release), which I will do _soon_.

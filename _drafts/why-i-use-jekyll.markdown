title: "Why I use Jekyll"
---

The first and simplest reason why I use [Jekyll][jekyll] is because it is easy.

The second reason why I use it, is because I want to be _different_.

<blockquote><p>It's <i>ok</i> to be different. But remember that it's <b>nice to experience too what all other people experience</b>. Shared experiences, that's what makes you bond.</p><footer><cite>Albert Camps</cite></footer></blockquote>

But the most important reason why I use [Jekyll][jekyll] right now is because thanks to [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] it allows me to have a _custom domain blog_ for **free**.

As at this point I have already taken the decision of using it, here are a few added benefits.

## Benefits

My programming knowledge allows me to **improve the themes without having to learn _anything more_ **- [liquid][liquid] is like many more, and I already am able to defend myself in HTML, CSS.

I can **write articles in plain text** from the comfort of the [terminal line][zsh] using [VIM][vim]. This might be a drawback, like it was for people at [Multunus][multunus].

I can **write completely offline** and sync when I want with git. Or use it as an _alternative to_ Dropbox with [my autocommiter][my_autocommiter].

There's an **awesome community** that is more involved than Wordpress community. People are more _learning-centered_ than _business-centered_ which makes it more enjoyable to search around.

## Issues

Tools for SEO are more limited than equivalent for _Wordpress_.

Since it's not a real backend, your _scheduling of posts_ is more complex. It is easy to sort it out, as I will show in a next post :).

Anyway I've seen people moving [from Wordpress to Jekyll][link1] and [back][link2].

Which blogging platform do you use? Which one would you recommend?

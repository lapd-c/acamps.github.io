how can you check the impact of one group having too many whales than other.

Is the feature helping? is a bias?

If a group randomly gets a few more whales and they are not excluded, that means that percentualy the other group has less than the share that should be normal.

Maybe representing the Whales as a percentage of AU in each group would help.

In this new series of posts, I will give a brief insight about what can improve business from my point of view.

Right now this feels extremely challenging, since I'm not used to think in terms of _business value_ nor anything similar.

## How to improve your business

### Use the right tools

My first advice, would be to **use the right tools**.

<blockquote>
<p>Using tools is what differentiates us from animals. Well, that and our ability to make the same mistakes.</p>

I'm going to use a [Point of Sale][pos] as an example.

A coffee shop can benefit inmensely from a good [Point of Sale][pos] system. Not only can everything be tracked better, but it leaves room for later analysis.

Trends can be studied, and even market acceptance of new products can be studied independently.

Next, business-related decisions would be better since they would be more informed. And you could forecast seasonability of some events easier.

### Introduce informed change

As I just mentioned, introducing a new product in your business and having an acceptance criteria can make a difference.

The important part is to be _informed_ at all times. You don't want to replace a product that was performing poorly, for a new one that performs worse.

This comes back to having the right tools. Having tools for comparing this behaviours between different new products, will help us choose the adequate ones.

As a side note, a friend and I just started working on a Point of Sale system that will rock, and be absolutely awesome. We'll be happy to give more information about it soon enough :)

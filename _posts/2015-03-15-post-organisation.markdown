Since I have taken this new challenge, I need to organize my posts in an improved way. This will come naturally with the help of a new redesign.

I haven't yet made my final move, but I'm choosing between [Pixyll][Pixyll], [HMFAYSAL](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/hmfaysal-notepad-theme/) [Almace Scaffolding](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/amsf/) and [Balzac](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/balzac/), in order of preference.

So probably I'll install first [Pixyll][Pixyll], play with it a little, and then include a few elements from the other three.

There were a few elements that will be missing and that I will have to integrate manually. This include [Disqus](https://disqus.com), and a maybe a few elements from Bootstrap. I like very much the [Scrollspy](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy) element, and I want to evaluate if it would be a good addition, or if it would clutter too much the design.

Hopefully, tomorrow I would be able to make this first changes, even if I decide not to publish yet I will update with something.

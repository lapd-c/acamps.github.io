If you have known me for some time, maybe you've heard that "I've been developing this project for my father"... for quite some time. The thing is that finally, some part of it it's done. It all started in the old days, when I had no idea of anything, and I tried something. Well, not only I, a good friend of mine helped me a lot, and we made it work. And we both learned some usefull stuff.

Thinking about that, and that now that my studies are over (for now), I decided I wanted to learn [node.js][node-js], and this seemed like a good thing to do, so I would refresh my HTML, CSS and JS knowledge, and even improve it.

Sooo, here I am, a few weeks before publishing this project that has had me working for about a month, and which hopefully will be helpfull to someone.

_**PS:** Hopefully I can update the references to GIT and some other resources to articles in this own blog soon enough. And link the project that now is private, to a [public repo][acamps-gh]_ 

_**PS2:** I need to install here some comment system._

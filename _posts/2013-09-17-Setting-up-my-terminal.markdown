So, let's say I installed everything back again, and yes I had my terminal set up, but now I wanted to make some small changes, that didn't take _that_ long, but they did take __longer__ than expected, so here you have the details.

First, you should keep [this][Special-Characters] at hand at all time, and you should know that I use [Steve Losh Guide][Awesome-zsh] as a guide. It is all based on [Zsh terminal][oh-my-zsh] and [iTerm2][iterm2].

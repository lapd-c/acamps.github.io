**I was not able to follow the challenge I casted upon myself.** Last week I failed to write three days.

The first time I failed, I kind of made up writting twice the following day, but as I had feared before, having failed once made it too easy to fail on Friday, and then again on Saturday.

I could use dozens of excuses, but truth is I wasn't strong enough to keep up.

The decision now is what to do now. Have I lost it all?

## What do I do when I failed?

Well, I could simply let it go. I could stop writing and made this effort I did purely anecdotical. But I don't want that.

I want the moment I decided to change my life, and start this blog, to last. To change my life.

I won't give up this easily. I want to reach my goal, and I want to even improve how I am doing this.

_I will compensate this two days without content by writing two articles on Monday and two on Tuesday._

I have to be hard on myself, because having skipped a few days shouldn't make it easier to skip more days in the future. That can be a real issue.

And I plan on improving. Starting tomorrow I plan on using better strategies, and will fight for my streak to be longer next time.

This [article](https://blog.bufferapp.com/idea-curation-get-more-ideas?utm_content=buffere1f92&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) points out how I want to continue in the future with my articles, even adding an additional step that would be: _future content generation_.

What do you do to continue when you fail at your objectives? Do you give up?

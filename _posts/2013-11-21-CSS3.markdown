As I was working today I found this image in a e-mail landing page, and I was about to just pngize it and use it as a background image in some div, when my former superior suggested to use CSS3. Not that much work, good idea to just think about something different, because I'm getting a lot of similar work, and I think I need to focus on improve this little details.

```css
#central{
	position:relative;
	left:50px;
	background-color: black;
	height:200px;
	width:200px;
}
#central:before {
	position:relative;
	left:-75px;
	display: inline-block;
	border-top: 100px solid black;
	border-left: 100px solid transparent;
	border-bottom: 100px solid black;
	/*border-right-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);*/
	content: '';
	transform: scale(0.5,1);
	-ms-transform: scale(0.5,1); /* IE 9 */
	-webkit-transform: scale(0.5,1); /* Safari and Chrome */
}
#central:after {
	position:relative;
	left:75px;
	display: inline-block;
	border-top: 100px solid transparent;
	border-left: 100px solid black;
	border-bottom: 100px solid transparent;
	/*border-right-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);*/
	content: '';
	transform: scale(0.5,1);
	-ms-transform: scale(0.5,1); /* IE 9 */
	-webkit-transform: scale(0.5,1); /* Safari and Chrome */
}
```

With this code you can mostly emulate an arrow. I found useful [this article][triangles], even though I needed to [scale][transformations] them and think a bit more about position. I could have played with a div and rotate it, for the :after part. I might do it after, to test the result.

When you are programming, sometimes concerns arise.

This concerns might come from different sources which I will resume here. And the one thing they all have in common is they block you. They impede you perform your work at a 100% of your capacities.

## Lack of time
This is a synonim of stress. When suddently something is urgent and needs to be done today, this will affect you.

I've heard some of this limitations inspire seniors to challenge themselves. Well, not for me.

### Solution
Keep a clear head. If you try to run too much, you might end up doing silly mistaskes that will break up your work.

## Lack of knowledge
In some ocasions, strange as it might sound, you might not have the _system's_ knowledge. Or maybe the architecture is not correctly documented. Or there are other things.

### Solution
Ask for help in your team. Schedule meetings if needed. Sometimes it is difficult to even notice that you need help; I would say that if your estimated time for a task has almost expired, and you don't see a real finite output, **go find help**.

Probably sooner.

## This is way too much
Maybe I'm the only one with this problem, but some times, when there's a mixture of a lack of the system plus a lack of time, I get this feeling of being overwhelmed by the task at hand.

It's like I can't wrap my head around it.

### Solution
**Divide and conquer**. Take your task and divide it into smaller more manageable steps that you are more certain you can manage. Do them. 

If you want to improve, even more, estimate how long they will take you, and work towards reaching that goal.

<blockquote><p>When you feel overwhelmed, first sit back. Then write a list, and then decompose it as much as you can. It's not about a small mouth, it's about immense chunks of food.</p><footer><cite>Albert Camps</cite></footer></blockquote>

When you have any of this _blockages_ telling your manager might help. It's good to know they won't be able to deliver sooner than later.

What blocks you when you need to work? How you solve it?

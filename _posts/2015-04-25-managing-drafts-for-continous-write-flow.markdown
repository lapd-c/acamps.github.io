When you are writting every day, as I do, you don't have a constant flow of ideas popping into your mind when you need them. Not at all. Storing drafts when you have ideas is a nice start, but you can do more.

There are a few more strategies you can use to help yourself go through your highs and downs.

## Good days

There are obviously good days when you can simply sit in front of your computer and the topic for the post comes to you straight away. Maybe your work was more inspiring or whatever, but you'll feel it.

On the good days you should write down on [drafts][drafts] any _spare_ idea you are not using the same day.

Truth be told, it is not that handy having a lot of files with only a title on it. I use and recommend another strategy. 

What I currently do is to **categorize the new ideas with the main category and then explain briefly the idea so I can further develop** later.

_PRODUCTIVITY: The pomodoro technique._

If you are writting every day too, it is important to learn to split your articles. It can be extremely helpful in a lot of ways.

## Normal days

This days usually after thinking for a while, you can get one idea or two to develop. You can _steal_ an idea after _surfing the web_, or check your work notes to use them as inspiration.

When you work, taking notes on small improvements you would do if you had time, is a key to a rich list of post ideas.

Taking notes on issues you have to google and solve, so you can share it with your co-workers also helps.

## Bad days

On the bad days I simply go back to the file I have with ideas from the good days. After all, I write because I like what I do and I want to share some insight.

It is hard to write when you only want to go to bed, but it's an interesting mental challenge to force yourself to do so anyway.

What definetely helps too is to find your rythm and **keep it up**.

How do you keep up with your challenges? What strategies do you use to blog?

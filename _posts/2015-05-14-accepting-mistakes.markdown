I think it all boils down to how you understand life.

But accepting mistakes at work, and being hard on yourself it's something you should be doing.

It's horrible to work with a group of people that avoid responsability and blame.

**If you take responsability, you should take blame.**

Blaming yourself for the errors also sets some psychological trigger that ensures you check twice next time, not to be seen as some error-prone person.

It's strictly personal, but I rather work in a company where people are able to assume their errors than a place where things magically go wrong and no-one could have done anything.

How do you deal with your mistakes? Do you take blame, or you try to blame someone else? It's always someone else's fault?

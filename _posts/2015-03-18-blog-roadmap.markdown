The _adventure of writing_ a blog post is _fascinating_, and it is affecting my life in several ways.

I know it is unfair to give my point of view when I haven't event finished a whole week, but so far I have noticed that blogging:

* Helps me staying **focused at work**.
* **Challenges my brain** in several ways
    * It keeps me busy thinking in ways to improve my blog: overall structure, plugins, fixing bugs, adding features.
    * Continue thinking about content that could be interesting from my daily work.
    * Forces me to think on interesting things to do at work in order to blog about them
* It gives me something to talk about
* Motivates me, since it gives me a clear **objective**.
* Helps me clarify what I really want to spend my time on. I have to decide where to invest my spare time at. That conscious choice is very important.

I plan to update this list in the future with more **side-effects**, but I'm happy with it so far.

### Roadmap
So my roadmap for this blog is, in the first place, achieve a month of _continuous flow_. Up to this point the_ quality_, _online presence_, and _other_ aspects are not very relevant, but the **important thing** is just to **keep it up**.

Once I have achieved a first month, a _flow_, I will gradually improve the quality of several aspects of the blog. Which will include:

* Incorporating _guest posts_. I am already considering the guests that could honor me writing about some specific subjects.
* Planning a few posts a week, and have some theme days. Like _refactoring Thursdays_ or stuff like that.
* Get to review a book, or share the insights it provided.
* Study the analytics, and get insight from the data.

I am open to suggestions about what you would like to see here, so please, give me your opinion, I will really appreciate it!

To give you my daily quote - which I hope you understand is a joke I make.

    Keep it up <strong>for a month</strong>. Once that's done, it's <em>all</em> done.

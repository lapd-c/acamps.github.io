For a longer time that I would care to admit, I have been seeing a few of my friends _succeed_. Either in long term engagements, or in personal projects. I was happy for them, and I thought that my time would come.

The time of _the big accomplishments_, if you have ever had the same feeling.

Tomorrow, 7th of April I'm turning 30. I guess I'm not old, but still I feel not _the same kind of youth_ is left in me.

I've been writing for more than 21 days in a row now. Not that I will stop now, but it is time to start throwing a bit of order into the mix. If I want something to come out of this, I need to start structuring it. None of this accomplishments will **come magically to me**.

I plan on starting **3 sections** - Monday, Wednesday and Friday- with the topics selected out of this poll. Next Monday will be the first.

What would you like to read about in this blog? My ideas at this moment are:

* **Discuss one article a week** - Give my personal insight about a relevant article
* **Discuss one video a week** - The same with a relevant video.
* **Work on open source** - A step by step guide as I enter the open source world.
* **Work on testing** - A weekly section on how to improve the testing process, even when you are not allowed at work.
* **Work on refactoring** - A weekly section on how to work with legacy code and refactor when there's a chance!
* **Updates** - A section on **news on the industry**
* **MOOC** - Both interesting courses, or notes. Yet to define better.
* **Books** - Selections, or comments on books. Maybe my notes on some books.
* **Training on something I know** - I would love to do small tutorials on different things. 
* **Kata on improving something (learn to measure resources/time) | limiting resources** - Programming exercises
* **Business improvements** - My ideas on how to improve selected areas of business.
* **Productivity** - How to better perform in general, from my point of view. My tips and tricks.

But I'm really **open to suggestions**!

Please, let me know in the comments section what you would prefer! Thanks for your time and kindness :)

I come more from a **Javascript** / **PHP** background, so I had never worked with [bundler][bnd], and I was having issues finding it online until I found [this](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) explanation page.

It works almost exactly as [npm][npm] or [composer][composer] I only need to specify what I want to install and _boil√†_!

In my scenario, with [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Github pages][gh-pages] I only need:

```
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'
gem 'jekyll-sitemap'
```

[Github pages][gh-pages] allow us to use the [jekyll-sitemap][j-sm] plugin, so to have feel in our local, we need to use it like this.

Finally, the biggest difference is, instead of `jekyll serve` I need to run:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Which is _extremely_ verbose for my taste. So I will **aliasize** it as soon as possible.

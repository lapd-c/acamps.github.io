Reading [this article][article] about the lack of time to learn in SCRUM, rings a few bells.

Even the article exemplifies what happens more at company level, I think it applies to your personal development life.

As I mentioned in my previous post about [your knowledge portfolio][portfolio], it is important to allocate some time **to learn** and **avoid using excuses**.

<blockquote>
<p>Don't allow yourself to break the flow. Continue diligently with your craft.</p>

The hard part is to first decide **what** you'll fit into your knowledge portfolio, and after that **when** you'll spend time learning.

For what I have found so far, a good solution might very well be to **write a blog** like my own. Both at a personal or at a work/company degree.

Well, _not exactly_. A blog with a few _clever_ solutions each week. Or one interesting article every now and then. Obviously no need of a daily post.

It really forces you, into setting some expectations of what you want to achieve. Into defining your goals.

How do you learn? Do you keep a record of what you are learning?

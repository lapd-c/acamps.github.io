Smartwatches are a bit at it's starting point. I just received an [LG G Watch R][lg] as a birthday present, and I'm impressed.

So far I haven't done much, but I plan on even developing my own applications. Or watchfaces.

I don't plan on getting rich on this, but in life, you never know.

What would you do with it? What would you use it for?

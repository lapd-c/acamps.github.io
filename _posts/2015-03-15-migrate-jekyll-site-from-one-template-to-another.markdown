### What do I need to do to migrate my site?

Apparently I could dump all my files - almost. The files in the `_post` folder are the ones to be kept, while all other content can be happilly discarted.

I'm not very keen on this, since I have been working on my page for a while, but lately my links were looking horrible, so changing is a must.

Moving from one template to another is easy, but now I noticed I want to incorporate more elements into the template that I would like to recognise.

**An interesting option** is to create my own. I'll keep this in mind, maybe for a next occasion.

Processes help standarize ways of working so problems don't arise with the same easiness.

Analyzing them at the begininng, when you are doing something new, may give you a new perspective.

If you do always the same things, you might detect what is wrong in your process, and can improve it until you have a better thing.

After some iterations, your processes can be even more consistent and can help you a lot.

But processes are not easy to follow, they need a lot of discipline. And it's important not to think that they are something solid impossible to move or change.

Do not see them as something distant. They are **your tool**. Your tool for being consistent and avoiding mistakes.

DO you have processes for doing things? I guess SCRUM might count as a process.

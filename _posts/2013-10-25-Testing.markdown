I've _run_ into a lot of trouble. Influenced by some of my peers and what I felt was best for my app development skills, I tried to implement some testing environment.

*First* I have added functional tests. I run them with [zombie.js][zombie] as a headless browser, with [mocha][mocha] and [should][should]. I've been learning a lot, and now I run in every test a new instance of my app with a brand new database schema, so I have total control of the status I'm at.

Later on, after some more time I was introduced to [code coverage][coverage], and I wanted to see _how much_ of my code was tested. Platforms like [istanbul][istanbul], [jscoverage][jscoverage] reported me some results. Not so lucky with [blanket.js][blanket] so far, as you can see in my [bug report][blanketbug] - I created my first [gist][buggist]!!

Overall I've been able to see my server code coverage, but nothing about my clientside code coverage. I reported [this question][question] to [Stack overflow][stack], but I haven't been lucky so far.

So as a work arround I started working with [RequireJS][require] and generating modules with my clienside code. I plan on using [controller][controller] and [singleton][singleton] patterns to make everything more modular, and test my modules independently.

That I can do with [mocha][mocha], as you can see in a __gist__ that should go here, but for the __coverage__ part I still get no result. _ATM_ I'm trying to push this forward even if it's weblike following [this][requiregist] and [this][blanketrequire].


On another totally different line of though, I started working on [git flow][gitflow], even though I don't follow it very strictly. But to use it right, with the amount of spare time I have to push the branches to origin and then delete them.
```
#Create
$ git push origin local-branch-name:new-remote-branch-name
#Delete
$ git push origin :remote-branch-name
```

__More soon!__

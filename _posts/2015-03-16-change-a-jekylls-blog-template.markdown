Luckily, in order to migrate from a basic template to a more advanced one, the only needed thing is:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Keep your _posts folder, protect it with your life.
  </p>
  <footer><cite title="Albert Camps">Albert Camps</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

In this case, my first move has been towards [Pixyll][pixyll], a fantastic piece of work by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com/) whom I don't know much about, but by the looks of his work, knows what he is doing.

The template allows direct configuration of mostly everything in the `_config.yml` file. **Extremely easy not to mess up**.

I want to add a few things to spice the page a bit more in the future, but this will be done in the following weeks.

For now, thanks for reading.

title: "Prepare your Retrospectives"
categories: scrum
---

I have mentioned that at [Social Point][sp] Analytics department we work with [SCRUM][scrum], with all the consequences.

_If you don't know what a retrospective is, you'd better google a bit about SCRUM, and you'll quickly find it._

I plan on sharing a bit of knowledge gained through retrospectives, but first **you have to know what to do at a retrospective**.

In the way we currently work, retrospectives _are often less usefull than they could_.

Why? Because actions to solve the issues are often forgotten, or simply noted but never implemented.

## You have to consider

* What are you doing, and which actions are you taking.

* How are you planning to implement this actions.

* How are you doing with the actions you defined on previous retrospectives.

It is good to have a source of knowledge where you can take notes about your sprints, even if it is only your point of view. And note the actions you plan on taking to improve your way of working.

One step at a time, focus on small improvements.

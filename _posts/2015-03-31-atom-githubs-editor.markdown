[Atom][atom] could be better described as Github own's flavoured [Sublime Text][st].

Probably the internals don't have much to do, one with each other, but what you can see as a user, doesn't differ that much.

A few months ago, there was a lot of excitement surrounding [Atom][atom]'s launch. **Invite only**, and all this techniques companies use to _generate expectation_. But it was a product in _early stages_ of development. Buggy, releases were frequent, and only a few plugins were available.

Now things have changed, and [Atom][atom] offers much more, and looks like polished product.

I will start using it again, even though most of my development activities are performed with [JetBrains][jb] applications, like [Pycharm][pycharm] or [PhpStorm][phpstorm]. I'll update you with how it works for me.

And if it is easy enough I will develop my own extension. I would love to have grammar checks on markdown, maybe using [atdtool][atd] or  any of the mentioned methods [here][server].

Have you developed your extensions? How would you check grammar in markdown? Let me know!

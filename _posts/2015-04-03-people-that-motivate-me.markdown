As I endure [this challenge][challenge] that I have chosen myself, I find people that offer some sparks, some _motivation_ or example to follow that make my journey easier to walk.

I will only share a couple of persons for now, but I will continue sharing this diamons as I find more of them.

## [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/)

The firts and most important reference that I want to mention is [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/). It was while reading his personal page that I decided to start this challenge, and seeing the progression that he accomplished. If you look at how his drawing evolved during only two years, with his [Paperfaces](https://mademistakes.com/paperfaces) project, it's astonishing.

## [Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/10-years-of-coding-horror/)

What can you say about Jeff Atwood that doesn't sound impressive. He is one of the minds behind [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com), and has been blogging for about 11 years now.

His style, and his _thought-flow_ are really cool and interesting.

His resolution to write **every week day**, that I had read a long time ago, helped me take my decision. It kind of clicked in me when reading [Michael Rose](http://www.mademistakes.com)'s articles, 

<blockquote>
<p>Find people that you can imitate some behaviours from. They can guide you, but don't convert them into figures of too much power</p>

Who amazes you? I would love to know more people that I could learn from!

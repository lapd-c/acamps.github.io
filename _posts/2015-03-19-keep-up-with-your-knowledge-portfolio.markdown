In the fantastic book [The Pragmatic Programmer][pragmatic] there's a section fully dedicated to your *knowledge portfolio* and how you should keep it updated and meaningful. But first things first.

### What is a knowledge portfolio?
A knowledge portfolio, is a place where you keep all of your knowledge related **objectevies** and **accomplishments**.

There you may have which programming languages you want to learn. Your side projects and what is the aim of this side projects.

The _relevant part_ about a Knowledge portfolio is that it must contain your **objectives**, your **goals**. And this forces you to do some goal-setting, which is an interesting activity.

### How can I keep track of my knowledge portfolio?
Right now I enjoy working with [vimwiki][vim], and the _general recommendation_  is to use plain-text notes.

This means almost _anything_, from [Evernote][ever] to using a [git][git] server -like [github][github] or [bitbucket][bit]- with notes in text files.

[Hackpad][hack] has found a path into my heart too.

Of course you could keep track of your portfolio with a Word document and a [Dropbox][drop] account. For me that would be far from optimal since I don't like depending too much in any other service.

### Why would I want a Knowledge Portfolio?
As mentioned before, creating an **intention** - focuses our mind into achieving the desired result.

A clear <strong>intent</strong> may not be much, but it is a damn lot more than nothing.

### General recommendations
A few recommendations that I am happy to apply myself.

* Read one book per quarter. Once you feel comfortable with this, try to push yourself to one book a month.
* Find a small project to work on your spare time that helps you apply and think about possible uses of the technologies, or languages you want to learn
* Get _involved_ with the community. That can mean programming for your city, or attending _programming dojos_, [meetups][meet] or similar activities.

The first option might not look like much, but compared to most of your peers --or your_ not-reading-self_- it will make a _difference_.

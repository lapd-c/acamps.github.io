As surprising as it might be, I've successfully ended my first non-stop month of blogging.

## Impressions

Right now I'm **really happy with my choice**. I think that blogging is helping me. I know I can do something more, but somehow I feel closer to my objectives.

This might have something to do with the fact of **challenging yourself and sticking to it**. And as you feel more accomplished, you can accomplish more.

Right now I'm having a few visits every day, not a lot, but more than I could have first anticipated. Most of them come through the SPAM I perform to friends and family, but a few come back after. And that's really cool.

I'm using [Buffer][buffer] for Twitter, which I kind of feel it's a waste of time, but I've only been with this strategy for about two weeks. Let's see how that ends up.

A few friends were actually _reading me without me knowing_, and that was really cool. Some others offered prizes if I succeed in this one-year challenge.

## What is to come

In the light of this new events, with this new knowledge I now have, I feel that I need to improve a few things on the blog. Some might be for personal reasons, some might be to get _better_ at blogging. Whatever that is.

* **Scheduled posts**: I need to have some material already prepared in case I can't write on a given day.
* **Sections + tags in posts**: if I'm starting a few sections an easy access to previous episodes of the sections must be easy to find.
* **Blog personalisation**: I already feel I would need a few more things of my blog, so it might be time of using other sources, and improve my current template.
* **SEO**: Wordpress and other platforms come better integrated with tools for SEO positioning. I need to work on that on my own.

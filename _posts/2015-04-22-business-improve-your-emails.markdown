Which ever your work is, it's likely that you'll have to send e-mails. And it's important to keep in mind that you don't want your e-mails to be read. You want your mails to **be understood**.

I would say more. You want your mental state of knowledge on a particular subject to be transferred to someone who can do something with that information.

Then it is important to **focus on key structured information**.

Take me for example.

I work at [Social Point][socialpoint], as you might know, and in my position we have to watch over the metrics and report back when something looks odd, so _analysts_ can do a deeper study.

In my last e-mails instead of just saying, _Hey, this metric looks weird, please, look into it_ I tried to determine **what was the underlying cause and I shared my first conclusions** on the subject, while trying to be very schematic at the same time and point out relations within the metrics, **so the e-mail receivers could have a better starting point that I had**.

The response was surprisingly good, since I wasn't expecting anything it made me very happy.

Maybe it's all about being proactive or not. I would say it's not only that.

What do you do to have maximum effectivity with your e-mails? Or do you feel they lack something? Share your tricks with me!

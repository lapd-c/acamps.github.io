Well, a few days have passed now an the results are the following:

* [3 votes] Create small tutorials
* [2 votes] Productivity
* [2 votes] Books
* [2 votes]Â MOOC
* [2 votes] Business improvements
* [1 vote] Refactoring
* [1 vote] Katas
* [1 vote] Testing

Thanks all who participated! It has been very surprising and motivating to see this participation! I was expecting to choose by myself, if I might be honest.

So finally, the three sections that you can expect to find here starting tomorrow are:

## Productivity Mondays

It is important to start the week fully loaded.

## Learning Wednesdays

Gather a bit of knowledge every week.

## Business Fridays

How could you improve a business? Food for thought for the weekend!

# Make no mistakes...

It doesn't mean that I would not speak about the other topics. As I try this new schema of things, **I might find that alternating Learning with Katas, Productivity with Books, and Business with Refactorings and testing spice the mix a bit and the result is more maintainable for me**.

Thanks all for your time, and hope to see you around here! Please share your opinions and thoughts.

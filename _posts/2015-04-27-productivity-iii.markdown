When you want to be productive a first step is to be do your work properly.

Since I'm a programmer, the best way to program is use _good practices_.

And what I've been working on lately is on avoiding code duplication.

This is specially difficult when working with [legacy code][legacy], but what helps is to [refactor][refactor] as much as possible.

Right now I find specially useful the _extract_ family of methods to accomplish this.

How do you avoid code duplication and are more productive coding?

In the crazy world we live, it's difficult to keep up, so you need to know where to find the more relevant news for you.

Here are a few examples I recommend:

## A trusted source:
Like [Hacker News](http://thehackernews.com/), there are a few pages you can trust in order to inform you. Every specific area of knowledge has it's own set of pages, so it's only a matter of finding yours.

## Reddit
If you don't know how this universe works, just mention it's worth a few minutes a day.

A way to explain what it is:

Imagine all your friends posting their favourite links in a webpage. In this webpage you can upvote the best, and downvote the ones you don't like.

The result is quite awesome.

And there's a huge amount of subreddits, probably about the subject you are interested on.

## Twitter
I recommmend following people who are known to be relevant people on the specific sector I am interested.

Besides that, a few companies offer nice information, if they have an active Twitter profile for **engineering**, like [Twitter Engineering](https://twitter.com/twittereng).

## Blogs
It's difficult to find everything you want in blogs, but having a good RSS reader and glancing at the headlines once in a while might give you a nice idea on the current trends.

Where do you read what's going on? Do you use all this sources? Or you get your attention in only one?

Thinking about that, and that now that my studies are over (for now), I decided I wanted to learn [node.js][node-js], and this seemed like a good thing to do, so I would refresh my HTML, CSS and JS knowledge, and even improve it.

Sooo, here I am, a few weeks before publishing this project that has had me working for about a month, and which hopefully will be helpfull to someone.

_**PS:** Hopefully I can update the references to GIT and some other resources to articles in this own blog soon enough. And link the project that now is private, to a [public repo][acamps-gh]_ 

<del><b>PS2:</b> I need to install here some comment system.</del>

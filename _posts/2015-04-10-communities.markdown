Here this might be more of a discussion subject, but right now, that's the point.

Today it was my last day as an active member in a community I've grown very fond of. And it is good to know what communities can do for you.

## What makes a _good_ community?

A _good_ community is a group of people that makes you feel **welcomed**, where you can easily **find information** and give your opinion.

Also it has to have a clear target, an objective. In this way it gives you, and your work a sense of **purpose**.

Communities help you grow, and help you achieve your objectives, while they can also boost your morale, since you will find yourself.

Which are your experiences in communities? How do you join them?

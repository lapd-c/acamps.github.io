Now it is decided. My problem is I don't find strength to daily fight the same issues, over and over again. Usually my motivation fades soon. I am tired of this, so I want to get into the **write a post a day** challenge.

I have been inspired by http://www.mademistakes.com and http://www.codinghorror.com . They both look to have gotten very far with this. I hope I can get at least half the way. Wish me luck.

No community, only myself. And shame on me if I fail.

Let's see if this blog is really populated after 365 days.

See you soon!

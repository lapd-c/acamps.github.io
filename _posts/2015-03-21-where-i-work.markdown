Currently, if you look at my [about][about] section, you won't see much relevant information about me.

This has to do with the fact that I haven't been able to spend enough time answering the question myself. And I have always found it quite difficult to answer this kind of personal questions.

Doing an effort to answer this question, I can at least say where I work, and how is my work there! So here I go:

----

I work at [Social Point][sp], a leading video-games company. My position is **analytics engineer**.

We work in a small 5 people development team where we focus our efforts in providing top-notch solutions to the company. This is, both the _data scientists_ - whom we work hand in hand- and any other part of the company who needs consistent information about the games our company has.

I will talk about both my _personal_ working methodology, and how we organise ourselves in the team at [Social Point][sp] in a **next post**.

Among some other things, we are responsible for assuring the **data** is being *transferred and stored* correctly from the games, and maintain and improve internal tools that help visualise and use all this data.

[Social Point][sp] is a great place to work at. Whatever your position I would say. Specially, as a developer here I feel myself with lots of opportunities, and the company invests on us, and takes our opinions into account. If we have an idea we think can improve a given aspect, we are usually given the resources to further work on it.

Even you can *never say never again* , I have yet *never* worked in a better place.

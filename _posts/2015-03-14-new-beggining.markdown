I have been working in *changing*. Apparently it is difficult, but I will work hard yet again.

> Know thyself.

That is, in short, a secret itself for achieving profound change. Change your routines. With constance, and without being afraid of failing, since life goes around in spirals. And each time you'll get closer to your objective.

So I am writing to prove a point.

From now on, I will reflect the daily challenges I encounter, both technically and personally at work.

This journey, will have to do with *programming*, *writting*, *being productive*, *data* and *knowledge*.

All expressed opinions and points of view, will be my own, and how I deal with the world around myself to **grow**, and **develop myself**.

The journey will have as an objective **growth**.

Thank you for reading.

When writing daily, it is easy to feel you are not on top of your game.

That's why I'm working on getting _sections_ on the blog, and changing my writting schedule to early in the morning. It's getting more and more difficult to get the ideas flowing at this moment of the day. And it is becoming increasingly hard to have something light to write about.

## Things that define quality

It is interesting to note what _defines quality_ because depending on which parameters we are measuring quality, I might end up with a **lame** blog, _top quality_.

Below you'll find my criteria for measuring and improving the quality of my blog.

### Insight

A good post is a post that provides insight. A solution difficult to come by, or a simple solution presented in an elegant way.

So far, a few of my articles are aligned with this.

### Straightforwardness

This is important. We live in a world too full with information. Why lose more time than necessary when we can be more direct?

A practical way to be straightforward might be to present examples, and images too that allow better understanding.

### Words

Words might be a tricky way to measure quality.

First, it depends on the objective of the article. A serious topic might require more words, while a programming trick might be very well served.

Second, an article as long as a tweet, is not an article.

So having different kinds of posts/articles is the solution. With a minimum and maximum amount of words, obviously.

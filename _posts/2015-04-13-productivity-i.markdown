Faithful to my promise, today I will talk about productivity. But first of all...

## What is productivity?

Productivity, in common-tongue is the ability to get more of your time. To be able to produce quickly. A productive person is someone that [get things done][gtd].

That sounds fantastic and something _everyone_ would like to achieve. I mean, we all get things done in the end, but probably we know that we could have gotten there much faster.

Something I want to work myself up to next Monday and that is **my first advice for increasing your productivity**, is **the work log**.

# The work log

This document -which might be handwritten or electronic- is where you should write down what you have accomplished every day. Write down when you started every task, and when you finished it.

Don't plan on getting it as a habit. Practice it only one week at a time.

<blockquote>
<p>Habits are difficult to create. Plan on 1-week challenges. Once you have conquered a week, build up from there.</p>

This first step is the most important of all, because it gives a _baseline_ from where to build up.

The _work log_ brings to consciousness a few parts of the **work process** that you usually leave unconscious, and with this knowledge you might improve.

So, work with me, and practice the work log every day until next week! After this week I will love to hear how it went for you!

_INFO_: I know there are tools for logging your work, but they usually don't allow to write the start time and the end time just like that. Try old-school and let's discuss in a week!

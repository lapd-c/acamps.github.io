I started thinking after reading [Speed matters: Why working quickly is more important than it seems][http://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters?utm_content=bufferdf247&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer] about how can the speed affect our way of working.

I've seen in people close to me, how *speed*, though vital is also a source of conflict, and how can we handle this.

As a matter of fact, I don't know how to handle this pressure myself, and in a near future, a shift in position in the company I work for, will probably increase severely this amount of pressure.

There are a few inherent risks of _working quickly_, which might include a drop in quality.

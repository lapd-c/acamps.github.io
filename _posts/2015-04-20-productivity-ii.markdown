In this second post about _productivity_ I will briefly talk about the [Pomodoro technique][pomodoro].

## The pomodoro technique

The [Pomodoro technique][pomodoro] is based on focusing on one task continuatedly during a period of time.

The idea is to split your time in **slots of 25 minutes** (_pomodori_ from now on), and then **rest for 5 minutes** that you can use for whatever other purpose. Use this schema up to **4 consecutive times**, and then, after the fourth **take a longer rest that can be about 20 - 25 minutes**.

After that, you can start all over again.

The main goal of this technique is to **avoid [burnout][burnout] and fatigue**.

<blockquote><p>Move often to avoid mental fatigue. You are water, and water that doesn't move rots.</p><footer><cite>Albert Camps</cite></footer></blockquote>

Of course, you might find your attention span **increasing** over the time.

[There's people][teknopaul] who recommend using _pomodori_ with a duration longer than 25 minutes, in fact,  as long as you can concentrate. But I find this might defy the purpose of avoiding [burnout][burnout] and fatigue, that I mentioned before.

### Tools

There are plenty of tools that you can use as timers. From your mobiles countdown, to specific mobile platform apps. I personally use [Eggscellent](http://www.eggscellentapp.com/) because it integrates with the calendar, and has an option for logging the name of the task and distractions. Another interesting option is the online [Marinara Timer][marinara].

### Recap

The [Pomodoro technique][pomodoro] helps you define better your objectives, since every _pomodori_  has to ideally have a clear objective. Then, in some way, works as SCRUM for your mind, you can have a plan of what to do in a whole day with all your _pomodori_ but adapt according to how things go.

It is easier to focus when you have only to deal with a small amount of work that needs your attention, and you can fight your _fear of starting_.

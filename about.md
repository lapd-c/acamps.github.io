Hi, my name is Albert Camps. I am a very curious guy, who's been a bit here and there. Big learning desires. Not an expert, but a journeyman.

I work at [Social Point](http://www.socialpoint.es) as an _Analytics Engineer_ wrapping my head around SQL, Python, Php, and a few more things. Having fun with it _most of the time_.

If you want to know more of me, just ask.
